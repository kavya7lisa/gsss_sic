$ value error 
ex: user give no is 15 when we try to turn it into a string then it's a value error
$ name error
$ syntax error
$ output formating 
'%-3s'
$ why in python we dont have increment and decrement options
$ learn __main__ in python
$ pep 3 and pythonic (learn from articals)
$ can we modify the list which is in the tuple


$ how to keep on inputting util a key is used to break the inputting using python.
ex: in c scanf(%[^#]s)
$ good and bad examplesof list/array.
$ in and out of function


$ why there is no index error in slicing?
$ implement a function find which memic find method in string.
$ ex: my_str ='mysuru'

$ accept a no from the user and find the next possible smallest no which is bigger than the given having all the digits of the given no.
$ create list with chocolate weight and take n(weights of chocolate) from the user and have one of the weight as a reference weight(first or last weight) and partition into 2(smaller and larger than partition weight).
