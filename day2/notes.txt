ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ - * // / % **

All operators are binary operators. They need 2 operands/values/input
The rule/syntax says we must place the operator in between the operands which is INFIX notation.
The I/P are numbers.
The O/P is number.
The operators + and - have the least precedence (heirarchy/preference)
All the Arithmetic operators except the power operator have Left to Right Associtivity.
x + y + z
4 + 5 - 19
Here, the expression 4 + 5 is evaluated 1st
2 ** 3 ** 2
Here 3 ** 2 is evaluated 1st.
NOTE:
The way +ve integers are stored in memory, the way -ve integers are stored in memory and the floating point numbers (number with precission) are all different.

HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM:

1. Read the problem statement carefully. List down the I/P data, relavant information. Isolate the unwanted information. Assertain what is the O/P.
Outcome: I/P we know, O/P we know

2. Find the solution. Forget programming. Find the solution using any specific technique or using some formula or trial and error method.
Outcome: We know the solution

3. Write the Algorithm. Step by step procedure. Each step must be simple, unambigious and finite.

4. Write the Fake-code (Pseucode)

5. Code it!

6. Unit testing, Cyxclomatic complexity (to find number of paths in the logic), optimize the logic.
